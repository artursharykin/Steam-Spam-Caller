# Steam Spam Caller
A simple Steam spam caller to annoy people.

We don't suggest calling people through the Steam overlay.

## Usage

### File
By default, it is recommended to use `Enter Key.ahk`. This file uses the Enter key to call the user, so the chat window can be placed anywhere on the screen.

There have been cases where the Enter key does not initiate a Steam call for some users. If this is the case for you, then you can use `Mouse Movements.ahk`. This version moves the mouse to press the "Start Voice Chat" button. Move the chat window to the top-left of your screen before beginning the program. Please note that Mouse Movements.ahk is calibrated for a 1920x1080 monitor.

### Controls
To start the script use `CTRL+J`. The user will be called every 1.1 seconds by default, because Steam doesn't allow faster ringing.

To pause the script, press `CTRL+J` again.

To terminate the script, press `esc`.

## Customization
The start hotkey can be edited to be any key. The `^` is the `CTRL` and the `j` is the `J` key. You can change it to whatever you desire.

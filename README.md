# Steam-Spam-Caller
A simple steam spam caller, it requires no effort except an initial click call button and run the program, to start the program its (ctrl+j) [but it can be edited to be any key, the {^} is the ctrl, and the {j} is the j key, pretty explainable and you can change it to whatever you desire]. After running the script it will automatically call the user, every 1.01 seconds, because steam doesn't allow faster calling, and to end the script, literally press the Escape key, it will stop the disk from being in your system tray, because all AHK devs think its better to pause the script and then you forget about it and get Vanguard or EasyAntiCheat eyeing you down...
I suggest calling someone NOT using the steam overlay because if you are playing a game like Rainbow Six Siege or something along the lines of that then, BattlEye will ban you faster than you could imagine.

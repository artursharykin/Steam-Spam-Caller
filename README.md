# Steam-Spam-Caller
A simple steam spam caller, it requires no effort except an initial click call button and run the program, to start the program its (ctrl+j) [but it can be edited to be any key, the {^} is the ctrl, and the {j} is the j key, pretty explainable and you can change it to whatever you desire]. After running the script it will automatically call the user, every 1.01 seconds, because steam doesn't allow faster calling.
